          Josh was born in Utah and raised in Wyoming. Having grown up in Wyoming and
          attended college in Colorado, Josh is no stranger to the Mountain West. He began
          his journey eastward living in both Arkansas and Tennessee for over a year each
          eventually leading him to travel to a total of 43 U.S. States. Josh later lived
          in Taiwan for 13 years as an educator and traveled to over 10 countries across
          Asia and Oceania. In 2015, Josh McAlister had begun serving as a dedicated
          college counselor, beginning his work at an international school in Taiwan and
          guiding students through applications to universities across the United States,
          the United Kingdom, Switzerland, South Africa, and New Zealand. In 2017, Josh
          moved with his family to continue working as a college counselor at a boarding
          school in central Utah.

          With a BA in Political Science, a Masters of Education (M. Ed), and over 20
          years of classroom experience in the US and abroad, Josh brings a deep
          understanding of diverse student pathways, tailoring guidance to each
          individual’s aspirations and strengths. His student-centered approach
          prioritizes building meaningful relationships, enabling him to understand
          students’ unique needs and create supportive programs that boost confidence,
          reduce stress, and allow them to remain focused on academics, athletics, and
          social life. Over the past eight years, Josh has further developed his expertise
          by attending national and regional college counseling conferences, as well as
          visiting a wide range of colleges and universities, building valuable
          connections and broadening his knowledge of the higher education landscape.

          Josh feels most at home outdoors. He loves snowboarding in the winter,
          paddleboarding and wakeboarding when it’s warm, and heading into the mountains
          any chance he gets. Since moving to Utah in 2017 with his partner, Jessie, and
          their two kids, exploring has become a family habit. Together, they’ve visited
          nine national parks and plenty of state parks, usually with their golden
          retriever, Koopa, tagging along. And when he’s not out on an adventure, you can
          usually find Josh chasing a ball—or watching one being chased.
