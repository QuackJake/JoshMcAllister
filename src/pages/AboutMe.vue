        Josh was born in Utah and raised in Wyoming. Having grown up in Wyoming and attended college in Colorado, Josh is no stranger to the Mountain West. He began his journey eastward living in both Arkansas and Tennessee for over a year each eventually leading him to travel to a total of 43 U.S. States. Josh later lived in Taiwan for 13 years as an educator and traveled to over 10 countries across Asia and Oceania. In 2015, Josh McAlister had begun serving as a dedicated college counselor, beginning his work at an international school in Taiwan and guiding students through applications to universities across the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, South Africa, and New Zealand. In 2017, Josh moved with his family to continue working as a college counselor at a boarding school in central Utah.

        With a BA in Political Science, a Masters of Education (M. Ed), and over 20 years of classroom experience in the US and abroad, Josh brings a deep understanding of diverse student pathways, tailoring guidance to each individual’s aspirations and strengths. His student-centered approach prioritizes building meaningful relationships, enabling him to understand students’ unique needs and create supportive programs that boost confidence, reduce stress, and allow them to remain focused on academics, athletics, and social life. Over the past eight years, Josh has further developed his expertise by attending national and regional college counseling conferences, as well as visiting a wide range of colleges and universities, building valuable connections and broadening his knowledge of the higher education landscape.

        Josh feels most at home outdoors. He loves snowboarding in the winter, paddleboarding and wakeboarding when it’s warm, and heading into the mountains any chance he gets. Since moving to Utah in 2017 with his partner, Jessie, and their two kids, exploring has become a family habit. Together, they’ve visited nine national parks and plenty of state parks, usually with their golden retriever, Koopa, tagging along. And when he’s not out on an adventure, you can usually find Josh chasing a ball—or watching one being chased.
